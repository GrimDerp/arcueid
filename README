Lisp in C.

See the file arcueid.org in the main directory of the distribution for
current functionality status.  It's an Emacs org-mode file (just plain
text), not a URL! Note: The URL arcueid.org is as of this writing a
fan site for the anime/visual novel Tsukihime: Lunar Legend (真月譚月
姫), which should explain where the name 'Arcueid' comes from. :)
