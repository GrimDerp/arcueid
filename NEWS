- Cleanup readline (hopefully)
- Memory leaks in dir and open-socket plugged
- Thread GC marker revised
- Further stability fixes

- Include Conan Dalton's Arc unit tests from Rainbow
- Bug fixes in ssyntax handling (a.1 now works instead of passing a symbol)
- Annotate will not annotate an object more than once against the same type
- nil now accepted as a parameter (which ignores its param)
- Internal overhaul of virtual machine code
- Internal overhaul of C foreign function interface (using trampolining)
