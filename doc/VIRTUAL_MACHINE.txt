This document such as it is, contains my design notes on the Carc
virtual machine.

The virtual machine is, like many of its kind, a stack-based virtual
machine.  It possesses four registers:

o An expression stack, called expr, which is a stack of values of
expressions that are being evaluated.  This is internally represented
as a vector, which is grown dynamically as necessary.

o A continuation register, which is a linked list of all the
continuations in use within the interpreter.
