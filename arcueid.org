* The Arc Runtime
** DONE base virtual machine [9/9]
    - [X] Define virtual machine architecture
    - [X] Design interpreter core
	  The interpreter core should be flexible enough that we can
	  easily use switch threading, call threading, GCC labels as
	  values, or even assembly language.  Each instruction should
	  be separately implementable.

    - [X] Environments [2/2]
          We use what Clinger et. al. call the stack/heap strategy.
	  Environments and continuations normally go on the stack, but
	  may be moved to the heap if required, e.g. when a closure or
	  continuation is required to outlive its initial context.
	  Environments can have their lives extended if one of
	  these things happens:

	  2. A function returns with a closure in its value register
	  3. A closure is stored in the global environment
          4. A closure is stored in an environment other than at level 0.

               Note that unlike for the numeric types (coerce "..."
               'int) is not the same as using (coerce "..." 'fixnum)
               or (coerce "..." 'bignum).  What it does amounts to
	       (coerce ... 'num) (see below) and then converts the
	       result into an integer type of appropriate size.
         - [X] string -> num (generic number conversion)
	       Converts any string into a number of the appropriate
               type. This should use the best available numeric type
               that is able to most accurately represent the value
               described by the string. Numeric base may be specified
               as an optional argument as before.

	       Basic algorithm makes the following tests:
	       1. If string ends with ‘i’ or ‘j’, convert as complex
	       2. If string contains ‘.’, convert as floating point.
               3. If base is less than 14 and the string contains
                  ‘e/E’, convert as floating point.
               4. If base is less than 25 and the string contains
	          ‘p/P’, convert as floating point.
	       5. If string contains ‘/’, convert as rational.
	       6. Otherwise, consider string as representing an integer

       - [X] ungetc - this is not part of standard Arc
	   Note that there is no ungetb function.  This is proving a
	   little tricky to implement.  Maybe what we should do is
	   simplify the semantics of ungetc so that it requires a
	   character to be unget'd, and the next call to readc OR
	   readb (yes, readb with a 'b'!) will return this
	   CHARACTER.  This saves us the trouble of decoding Unicode
	   all over again, and reinforces the maxim of never mixing
	   the b functions with the c functions.

	   separate 'byte index' into what is made up of characters.

** TODO REPL [0/3]
   - [ ] Simple non-readline REPL
   - [ ] Read in an initial file for REPL
   - [ ] Readline support
** TODO Formatted output
   In addition to Arc standard prf, there will also be a printf
   function which can be used to output strings according to a format
   string specified.  The usual conversion specifiers for standard C
   printf are available, with some additional non-standard ones:
   - r or m : no argument required - print the output of
     strerror(errno).
   - v : replace by the pretty-printed form of the argument.

   This is also the same format specification used by the error
   handler function signal_error.

** TODO Dynamic Loader for external C functions
** TODO CIEL (src/ciel.c) [0/18]
   The CIEL dump/restore functionality allows Arcueid to save and load
   workspaces by tracing the global symbol table and threads and dumping
   those to a file.

* Enhancements
** TODO use ropes as strings
   This is a valuable enhancement as efficent string handling for very
   long strings will be very useful.
** TODO true OS-level threading
   The current interpreter is designed with green threads, scheduled
   by the virtual machine rather than native threads.
** TODO more advanced memory allocator
** TODO just in time compilation
** TODO PreArc?
   We do want to someday make a statically-typed, non-garbage
   collected dialect of Arc similar to Richard Kelsey's PreScheme, so
   we can write the entire runtime in Arc.
** TODO Format strings
   We will provide for format strings similar to C, but with a few
   extensions that make sense for Arc.
** TODO Character/string comparisons/translations
   Character/string comparisons, by default use the Unicode Collation
   algorithm (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/)?  Capitalization
   and decapitalization should also be locale-defined. An
   implementation of the algorithms for doing these things appears to
   be ICU4C (http://site.icu-project.org).  See if we can adapt the
   code or use it as a library.
* Limitations that should be lifted
** Macro expansion
   - Macros cannot use threading primitives. Attempting to do so with
     the current version of arc_macapply will cause an immediate
     deadlock because macros are executed single threaded as the only
     thread available.
   - Garbage collection not performed during macro execution.  This
     requires some fairly careful work to ensure that local variables
     inside the compiler do not get garbage collected.
   - Macros can be anything but a CC4 function.  CC4 functions make some
     subtle interplay between the virtual machine and all that and can
     be somewhat difficult to handle.
** Compilation
   - We need to do tail call optimization somehow!
   - We need to do something about the kludge involved in reversing
     arguments for evaluation order.  Compiling a function application
     will push the arguments in the order in which they appear (so
     they appear on the stack in reverse order), but the compiler
     generates code to bind arguments on the stack as if they were
     pushed in the opposite order!  In order to fix this we have
     modified the virtual machine to reverse the order of all
     arguments in arc_apply. This is a really ugly kludge and should
     be cleaned up.
** Complex Rationals
   Apparently Arc has a complex rational numeric type:
   e.g. (sqrt -1/4) => 0+1/2i.
   At present Arcueid has no plans to support such creatures, and
   (sqrt -1/4) will produce 0+0.5i instead.  I suppose this is an
   artifact of numeric tower support in MzScheme/Racket, given the
   paucity of functions to otherwise support complex numbers in Arc.
