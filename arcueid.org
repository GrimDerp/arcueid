* The Arc Runtime
   We want to be able to write as little of the runtime in C as
   possible.  Of course, unless we have an Arc to native compiler, or
   even a limited one analogous to Richard Kelsey's PreScheme, we have
   no choice but to write a few portions in C.  I don't yet have the
   chops or the time to make one like that now, but that would
   certainly be ideal, and then we'd have an Arc just like Scheme48.
** TODO base virtual machine [4/7]
   We need to rethink the structure of the virtual machine.  It now
   seems that vmgen might not have been such a good idea, and we
   should probably write our own interpreter core directly.
    - [X] Define virtual machine architecture
    - [X] Design interpreter core
	  The interpreter core should be flexible enough that we can
	  easily use switch threading, call threading, GCC labels as
	  values, or even assembly language.  Each instruction should
	  be separately implementable.

** DONE memory management [2/2]
   - [X] memory allocator
	 A very simple free-list based memory allocator.  There might be
	 better algorithms out there but let's get a simple one out
	 the door first and then worry about making it more efficient
	 later.
   - [X] garbage collector
	 We use the Huelsbergen-Winterbottom VCGC algorithm.  We use
	 it single-threaded exactly the way Inferno uses it, with
	 interpretation interleaved with garbage collection.  Later on
	 when we have real threads in the language we'll make it into
	 a real threaded implementation with a real OS-level thread to
	 do the marking and sweeping.
** DONE compiler in Arc
    Debugging and feature-completeness are all on the agenda of course.

	   little tricky to implement.  Maybe what we should do is
	   simplify the semantics of ungetc so that it requires a
	   character to be unget'd, and the next call to readc OR
	   readb (yes, readb with a 'b'!) will return this
	   CHARACTER.  This saves us the trouble of decoding Unicode
	   all over again, and reinforces the maxim of never mixing
	       the b functions with the c functions.

** TODO write a base reader for CIEL files (src/ciel.c) [1/2]
   Our CIEL bytecode interpreter must at the very least support the

** TODO rewrite reader in Arc

** TODO write pretty printer in Arc
** TODO Formatted output
   In addition to Arc standard prf, there will also be a printf
   function which can be used to output strings according to a format
   string specified.  The usual conversion specifiers for standard C
   printf are available, with some additional non-standard ones:
   - r or m : no argument required - print the output of
     strerror(errno).
   - v : replace by the pretty-printed form of the argument.

   This is also the same format specification used by the error
   handler function signal_error.

** TODO Additional CIEL instructions [0/3]
   The following additional instructions are required by the final version:
   - [ ] gtab
   - [ ] ctadd
   - [ ] additional functionality for cannotate, so that it can, you
	 know, actually perform type annotations...
* Enhancements
** TODO use ropes as strings
   This is a valuable enhancement as efficent string handling for very
   long strings will be very useful.
** TODO true OS-level threading
   The current interpreter is designed with green threads, scheduled
   by the virtual machine rather than native threads.
** TODO more advanced memory allocator
** TODO just in time compilation
** TODO PreArc?
   We do want to someday make a statically-typed, non-garbage
   collected dialect of Arc similar to Richard Kelsey's PreScheme, so
   we can write the entire runtime in Arc.

* Bugs
** TODO seek/tell may have 32/64 bit compatibility issues
   We might not have large file support on 32-bit builds.  This needs
   to be fixed, and we may need bignum support for arc_seek/arc_tell.
