* The Arc Runtime
** TODO base virtual machine [5/7]
   We need to rethink the structure of the virtual machine.  It now
   seems that vmgen might not have been such a good idea, and we
   should probably write our own interpreter core directly.
    - [X] Define virtual machine architecture
    - [X] Design interpreter core
	  The interpreter core should be flexible enough that we can
	  easily use switch threading, call threading, GCC labels as
	  values, or even assembly language.  Each instruction should
	  be separately implementable.

      - [X] Arcueid Foreign Functions (AFF)
    - [ ] Enable GCC's labels as values for doing interpreter threading
	  The macro structure is already in place.  We only need to fill
	  in some of the conditional compilation stuff and defines.
    - [X] Type invocations [5/5]
	 We need to modify the arc_apply function so that it becomes
	 possible to apply objects of these various types

** TODO Runtime Built-In Functions [2/19]
   Consider whether or not to provide instructions for the asterisked
   functions, so as to make their use cheaper.
   - [ ] Initialization for binding runtime primitives to global symbols
   - [ ] Type handling [0/5]
     - [ ] coerce [0/10]
       - [ ] Integer conversions [0/5]
	     Note that fixnum and bignum may be used as aliases for int
         - [ ] char -> int (results in a fixnum from 0 - 0x10FFFF)
         - [ ] flonum -> int
	       Either fixnum or bignum as needed.
         - [ ] complex -> int
	       optional argument for imaginary, use 'im
         - [ ] rational -> int
	       May return fixnum or bignum as needed
         - [ ] string -> int, base specified as optional arg
       - [ ] Flonum conversions [0/5]
         - [ ] fixnum -> flonum
         - [ ] bignum -> flonum
         - [ ] rational -> flonum
         - [ ] complex -> flonum
	       Extra argument for Im(z)
         - [ ] string -> flonum
	       A base may be specified here as well.  Arc3 does not allow
	       specification of an exponent for bases greater than 14, but
	       Arcueid allows alternate use of an '&' character to denote
               exponents (after Simula), or a 'p/P' character for bases
               less than 25 (as per strtod).  The strings 'Â±inf' and 'nan'
               with any capitalization, with or without a trailing .0, will
               create an infinity or a NaN respectively.
       - [ ] Rational conversions [0/5]
         - [ ] fixnum -> rational
	       This has no real effect.  It will still return the original
	       fixnum, without error.         
         - [ ] bignum -> rational
	       Also has no effect, returning the original bignum without
	       error.
         - [ ] flonum -> rational
         - [ ] complex -> rational
	       Extra argument for Im(z)
         - [ ] string -> rational, base specified as optional arg
	       May return a fixnum or a bignum instead depending on the
	       value therein.
       - [ ] Complex conversions [0/5]
         - [ ] fixnum -> complex
	       Works the same as fixnum -> flonum
         - [ ] bignum -> complex
	       Works the same as bignum -> flonum
         - [ ] flonum -> complex
	       Has no effect, returning the original flonum
         - [ ] string -> complex
	       May return a flonum if no imaginary part is specified.
	 - [ ] cons -> complex
       - [ ] String conversions [0/10]
	 - [ ] nil -> string
         - [ ] char -> string
         - [ ] fixnum -> string
	       Has extra argument specifying base
         - [ ] bignum -> string
	       Has extra argument specifying base
         - [ ] rational -> string
	       Has extra argument specifying base
         - [ ] flonum -> string
         - [ ] complex -> string
         - [ ] cons -> string
         - [ ] vector -> string
         - [ ] symbol -> string
       - [ ] Cons conversions [0/4]
         - [ ] rational -> cons
	       car = numerator, cdr = denominator, could be fixnums or
	       bignums as needed.
         - [ ] complex -> cons
	       car = Re(z), cdr = Im(z)
         - [ ] vector -> cons
         - [ ] string -> cons (char list)
       - [ ] Symbol conversions [0/2]
         - [ ] char -> sym
         - [ ] string -> sym
       - [ ] Vector conversions [0/2]
         - [ ] string -> vector (char vector)
         - [ ] cons -> vector
       - [ ] fixnum -> char
             limit to 0 - 0x10FFFF, also exclude 0xd800-0xdfff, invalid
	     Unicode block.
       - [ ] string -> num
	     Converts any string into a number of the appropriate
	     type.  This should use the best available numeric type
	     that is able to most accurately represent the value
	     described by the string.  Numeric base may be specified
	     as an optional argument as before.

	     Basic algorithm makes the following tests:

	 1. If string ends with 'i' or 'j', convert as complex
	 2. If string contains '.', convert as floating point.
	 3. If base is less than 14 and the string contains 'e/E',
	    convert as floating point.
	 4. If base is less than 25 and the string contains 'p/P',
	    convert as floating point.
	 5. If string contains '&', convert as floating point.
	 6. If string contains '/', convert as rational.
	 7. Otherwise, consider string as representing an integer

	   Note that there is no ungetb function.  This is proving a
	   little tricky to implement.  Maybe what we should do is
	   simplify the semantics of ungetc so that it requires a
	   character to be unget'd, and the next call to readc OR
	   readb (yes, readb with a 'b'!) will return this
	   CHARACTER.  This saves us the trouble of decoding Unicode
	   all over again, and reinforces the maxim of never mixing
	   the b functions with the c functions.

** TODO Formatted output
   In addition to Arc standard prf, there will also be a printf
   function which can be used to output strings according to a format
   string specified.  The usual conversion specifiers for standard C
   printf are available, with some additional non-standard ones:
   - r or m : no argument required - print the output of
     strerror(errno).
   - v : replace by the pretty-printed form of the argument.

   This is also the same format specification used by the error
   handler function signal_error.

** TODO Dynamic Loader for external C functions
** TODO CIEL (src/ciel.c) [0/18]
   The CIEL dump/restore functionality allows Arcueid to save and load
   workspaces by tracing the global symbol table and threads and dumping
   those to a file.

* Enhancements
** TODO use ropes as strings
   This is a valuable enhancement as efficent string handling for very
   long strings will be very useful.
** TODO true OS-level threading
   The current interpreter is designed with green threads, scheduled
   by the virtual machine rather than native threads.
** TODO more advanced memory allocator
** TODO just in time compilation
** TODO PreArc?
   We do want to someday make a statically-typed, non-garbage
   collected dialect of Arc similar to Richard Kelsey's PreScheme, so
   we can write the entire runtime in Arc.
** TODO Format strings
   We will provide for format strings similar to C, but with a few
   extensions that make sense for Arc.
** TODO Character/string comparisons/translations
   Character/string comparisons, by default use the Unicode Collation
   algorithm (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/)?  Capitalization
   and decapitalization should also be locale-defined. An
   implementation of the algorithms for doing these things appears to
   be ICU4C (http://site.icu-project.org).  See if we can adapt the
   code or use it as a library.
* Limitations that should be lifted
** Macro expansion
   - Macros cannot use threading primitives. Attempting to do so with
     the current version of arc_macapply will cause an immediate
     deadlock because macros are executed single threaded as the only
     thread available.
   - Garbage collection not performed during macro execution.  This
     requires some fairly careful work to ensure that local variables
     inside the compiler do not get garbage collected.
   - Macros can be anything but a CC4 function.  CC4 functions make some
     subtle interplay between the virtual machine and all that and can
     be somewhat difficult to handle.
** Compilation
   - We need to do tail call optimization somehow!
   - We need to do something about the kludge involved in reversing
     arguments for evaluation order.  Compiling a function application
     will push the arguments in the order in which they appear (so
     they appear on the stack in reverse order), but the compiler
     generates code to bind arguments on the stack as if they were
     pushed in the opposite order!  In order to fix this we have
     modified the virtual machine to reverse the order of all
     arguments in arc_apply. This is a really ugly kludge and should
     be cleaned up.
** Complex Rationals
   Apparently Arc has a complex rational numeric type:
   e.g. (sqrt -1/4) => 0+1/2i.
   At present Arcueid has no plans to support such creatures, and
   (sqrt -1/4) will produce 0+0.5i instead.  I suppose this is an
   artifact of numeric tower support in MzScheme/Racket, given the
   paucity of functions to otherwise support complex numbers in Arc.
