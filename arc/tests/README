This directory contains Conan Dalton's unit tests for Arc.  These were
originally intended for his Rainbow (Arc in Java), but they are
supposedly universal and should work for any Arc implementation.

A few notes here:

1. There are many places where the unit tests originally made absolute
   comparisons of floating point numbers.  Anyone who does numerical
   programming often enough quickly learns not to do that, and do an
   (< (abs (- x y)) tol) where tol is a tolerance that should be
   sufficiently small.  I have modified things so as to use this
   pattern (with a tolerance of 1e-6 generally).
2. One of the things these tests have shown is that Arcueid's
   straightforward numerical conversion algorithms leave much to be
   desired.  They are less accurate than the ones used by MzScheme or
   Rainbow.

We don't use very sophisticated numerical conversion algorithms
(yet).  Perhaps someday someone (probably me) will code these in.
