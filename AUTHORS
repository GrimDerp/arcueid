The Unicode handling code in src/utf.c is based on the UTF-8 code in
Inferno's lib9, originally written by Rob Pike and Ken Thompson,
modified by Rafael Sevilla to handle astral plane characters in full
compliance with RFC 2279.  Copyright (c) 1994-1999 Lucent Technologies
Inc.  Revisions Copyright (c) 2000-2007 Vita Nuova Holdings Limited
(www.vitanuova.com).

The hash functions used in hash.c are the hash functions proposed by
Bob Jenkins (lookup3.c on 32-bit and lookup8.c on 64-bit builds).  See
http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/index.html for more details.

The random number generator is also based on an algorithm devised by
Bob Jenkins, ISAAC64 (used on all builds).  See
http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html for more details.

The soon to be infamous calling convention 4 used to allow C extension
functions to call into Arcueid virtual machine functions is inspired
in large part by Simon Tatham's C coroutines.  See
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html for more
information on the technique.

The autoconf readline testing code in m4/ax_lib_readline.m4 is

The Arc core code in arc/arc.arc is Copyright (c) 2009 Paul Graham and
Robert Morris.

The test suite in arc/tests comes from Rainbow and is Copyright (c)
2008 Conan Dalton.
